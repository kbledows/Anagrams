# Anagrams

Created by Konrad Bledowski  

### What is this?  
This repository hosts a 6 letter anagrams solver. Essentially, my program will generate a list of all possible words after the user enters any set of 6 letters. The program uses a text file containing 100,000 of the most common words in the English dictionary, and uses a recursive function to check whether combinations of the provided letters yields words found within the text file.

## Why did I create this?

I created this to help me play the "anagrams" word game in 'GamePigeon' against my friends. I'm not very good at the game, so I thought, why not write a solver to help me cheat?

## Overview
To play, simply run the python script in your terminal. Then enter your 6 letters to generate the list of words.

The list will be sorted by the length of each word, with the longest words appearing first.

I hope you enjoy using my anagrams solver!
